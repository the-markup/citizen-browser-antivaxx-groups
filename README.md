# Citizen Browser: Facebook recommendations for anti-vaccine groups
This repository contains data from the story ["Facebook Said It Would Stop Recommending Anti-Vaccine Groups. It Didnâ€™t"](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/05/20/facebook-said-it-would-stop-recommending-anti-vaccine-groups-it-didnt) from from our series, [Citizen Browser](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/).

Our methodology is described in "[How We Built a Facebook Inspector](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/how-we-built-a-facebook-inspector)."

## Data
The `data/` directory contains files with data from the story.

1. `health_keywords.txt` contains a list of 12 health- or illness-related keywords that were used to identify an initial list of groups that were likely to be focused on health.
2. `negative_keywords.txt` contains a list of terms we used as a broad filter to remove groups that were not truly related to human physical or mental health.
3.  `recommended_health_groups.csv` contains the full list of groups recommended to Citizen Browser panelists that contained one or more of the health keywords and no negative keywords in the group name.
4. `anti-vaccine_content.csv` contains a list of groups and pages recommended to panelists that were dedicated mainly to the sharing of anti-vaccine misinformation.
5. `anti-mask_content.csv` contains a list of groups and pages recommended to panelists that were dedicated mainly to criticizing or discouraging the wearing of masks.
